Time/Elapse version 1.23
========================

Time::Elapse is a very simple class with one method: lapse.


Basically, the lapse method 'eats the brains' of the variable,
squirrels away whatever value it may have held internally,
(much like space aliens are known to do in the movies), and also stores 
the current time within it. Then, whenever you access the value of 
the variable, the 'alien' within formats the time differential 
between when you initialized the variable, and when you printed it, 
and returns that (along with any value the variable may hold, as well). :-) 
Every time you print it, you get the updated differential, returned by 
the method hidden inside the variable itself. The output will be formatted 
as HH:MM:SS.000000 [in Microseconds].


Frankly it doesn't do much more than time(), but then again the simplest 
things rarely do. :-)


All it really does is hides the calculations that anyone else would have had 
to set up manually in a clever way and then produce a reasonably formatted 
output which lends itself equally well to single-line output or inlining with
other text.
